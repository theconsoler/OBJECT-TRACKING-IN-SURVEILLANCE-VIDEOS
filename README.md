OBJECT TRACKING IN SURVEILLANCE VIDEOS

üöÄ Object Tracking in Surveillance Videos
This repository contains the Infosys Project: Object Tracking in Surveillance Videos, an implementation designed to track objects in video feeds using advanced computer vision techniques. The project utilizes OpenCV, YOLOv4, and other state-of-the-art tools to detect, classify, and track objects in real-time.

üìù Project Overview
The goal of this project is to implement object tracking for enhanced surveillance systems. By leveraging pre-trained deep learning models, the system identifies and tracks objects across video frames, providing valuable insights into motion and activity.

The key features include:

Object Detection using YOLOv3 and YOLOv4.
Real-time Tracking with custom object identifiers.
Visualization of object paths and detection boundaries.
Pixel Analysis for frame-by-frame insights.
Data Visualization using Matplotlib for histogram and RGB channel analysis.

üìÅ Project Structure
Installation and Setup: Instructions to set up dependencies.
Code Examples: Modular Python scripts for object detection and tracking.
Sample Videos: Real-world use case examples (user-provided video required).
Output: Processed videos with annotations, histograms, and other analysis.

üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Before you begin, ensure that you have Python installed. Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

Install required Python libraries:

pip install opencv-python matplotlib pandas torch torchvision torchaudio imageai

Download YOLO models:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/imageai.mirror/files/3.0.0-pretrained/tiny-yolov3.pt/download

https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v3_optimal/yolov4.weights

https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names

Place the YOLO files in the models directory:


import os
os.makedirs("models", exist_ok=True)

Verify installation:


import torch
print("CUDA available:", torch.cuda.is_available())

üñ•Ô∏è Usage
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-tracking-surveillance.git
cd object-tracking-surveillance

Run the project:


python object_tracking.py

Provide a video file in .mp4 format and ensure the path is updated in the script:


input_video_path = "path/to/your/video.mp4"

Output video with object annotations will be saved as output_video.mp4.
